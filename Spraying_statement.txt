In the Mood for Love is a 2000 Hong Kong romantic drama film written, produced, and directed by Wong Kar-wai. Its original Chinese title means "Flowery Years". It tells the story of a man (played by Tony Leung) and a woman (Maggie Cheung) whose spouses have an affair together and who slowly develop feelings for each other.

In the Mood for Love premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival on 20 May,[1][2] where it was nominated for the Palme d'Or and Tony Leung was awarded Best Actor (the first Hong Kong actor to win this award at Cannes). It is frequently listed as one of the greatest films of all time and one of the major works of Asian cinema. In a 2016 survey by the BBC, it was voted the second-best film of the 21st century by 177 film critics from around the world.

The movie forms the second part of an informal trilogy, alongside Days of Being Wild (1990)[3] and 2046 (2004).
