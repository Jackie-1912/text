Happy Together is a 1997 Hong Kong romance film directed by Wong Kar-wai, starring Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-wai, that depicts a turbulent romance. 

The English title is inspired by the Turtles' 1967 song,[2] which is covered by Danny Chung on the film's soundtrack; the Chinese title (previously used for Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup) is an idiomatic expression suggesting "the exposure of something intimate".[3]

The film was regarded as one of the best LGBT films in the New Queer Cinema movement[4] and received positive reviews and screened at several film festivals such as the 1997 Toronto International Film Festival;[5] it was nominated for the Palme d'Or and won Best Director at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.[6]
